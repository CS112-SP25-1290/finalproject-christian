Video Game Tracker

This project is a personal video game collection manager inspired by my own growing collection and the challenge of keeping track of what I own. I wanted a simple, organized way to log games by platform, condition, price paid, and estimated value—similar to features you’d find on sites like PriceCharting or Backloggd, but more customizable. It combines my interest in gaming with practical programming skills to create something genuinely useful.

I could not add the Cover art like I wanted to. I orginally wanted to have the ability to click on the games and it opens up to more info and shows the image. Ultimately I decided to drop it in order to get a concise project and not break it with errors.
